(But people have said the Tesla is sort of a Lego Car, so it is easy to work on if you don't care about voiding your warranty and can get parts.)\nAlso, the \"autopilot\" over-promises and under-delivers. However, the over-promising could put a less than vigilant driver in a bad position. (One example is its erratic behavior on the detour scenario you were in and the crazy move over 2 lanes maneuver.) \nMy experience is the companies that take a more conservative approach like Toyota, deliver a much safer car on their enhanced-Cruise-Control-Lane-Hold mode. I have used it in residential zones and it performs flawlessly. The only glitch I see is it tries to \"split-the-difference\" and go too near an off ramp when the roadside white line veers off. But then, Toyota says you are supposed to have your hands on the wheel at all times and will warn you and deactivate if you are off the wheel for too long.",

Last place goes to the Mercedes, barely beat the Buzz, but the Audi was borderline given that 75% which is pretty poor (verging on BS).\n\nI'd take the ID Buzz for the practicality if I could choose one. I already drive a 'van-like' car for that reason. I actually think this made me think even more positively about it as I expected the 'real' range to be so bad it would have been a pain. These are all prohibitively expensive though. I see the future of driving being something only the rich can do.

Raw cobalt is very hazardous to the children that the Chinese allow to mine with their bare hands.  China and Russia own most of this mining; they hardly care about humanity or wildlife in their own countries, what do they care about their third world hosts?  Let’s all wake up to the WEF globalist corruption if not evil one world intentions.  UN Agenda 2030, which BTW does not allow for the mass individual driver independence that we enjoy now.  They want us stuck in cities taking mass transit for travel while they enjoy elite only freedoms.  BTW, Germany’s (and much of EU) near term energy supply cannot support mass adoption of EV transportation.

    "Electric vehicles have a huge danger that is deliberately hidden! The fact that if the internal temperature of Li-ion batteries rises above 60C, an unstoppable chemical fire will start! Because every cell in a lithium-ion battery contains a flammable liquid electrolyte, when the cell is short-circuited, the electrolyte can burn and the pressure rises rapidly. Thermal entrainment is an unstoppable chain reaction that causes a fire of 60 degrees and above. After this fire started, there is a possibility of explosion if there is no solid compartment between the batteries. When a battery-powered vehicle is used at high temperatures, especially in the city, at low speeds, the internal temperature of the batteries becomes very high. For this, well-known brands take security measures with large R&D investments. But do cheap Chinese car brands take these precautions? All vehicles that have not passed the test are potentially dangerous. As electric vehicles become more common, it's not even sincere that we see cars burning or even exploding on hot summer days... In addition, connecting an overheated battery to fast charging is also a huge risk.",

Times that by 4.5 to get your  rough gallon £7.29. My 2.0 bmw will easily do 45mpg but we will use 30 mpg to be more average for day to day use.  £7.29/30= 24p per mile rounding down.\n\nMy car will do 600 mile per tank. \n\nEv vehicles make sense if you have solar panels and ways of generating electricity at home for very cheap. You require apps and all the other stuff to use charges out and about.\n\nThe way forward surly will be hydrogen fuel cell cars because evs are just not practical.  And as I demonstrated cost more per mile. Do less millage, the charging point infrastructure is non existent. And when their is one a Tesla at a super charging station takes 15 mins to give you 200 mile of range.\n\nThe max range a Tesla will do is a quick google search 405 miles can take anywhere from 11 hours to 44 hours.\n\nThe best a Tesla managed on a motorway is 280 miles at 70 mph.\n\nSo if you was on holiday at the Edinburgh tattoo for instance and you lived in London a trip of 403 miles. Town to town.  You would spend 30 mins charging at a super Tesla charging station if your lucky to find them or need a spare day to charge it.\n\nThat’s my opinion not here to argue.  Feel free to correct my point of view. But dnt bring cheap name calling and stuff cheers",

    "None of these cars would work in the US. The US is too large and people are too spread out. The average american can easily do 500 miles in a day on a trip, which is about 8 hours of driving at 70 mph with a few quick stops. I've seen people that try to do long distance trips in Teslas and they don't make it far before they are charging their vehicles. I never see any other electric vehicles attempting long distance trips. \n\nMy estimation is that an electric car needs to be able to do at least 300 miles at 70 mph between charges and needs to be supercharger compatible. If a person stops every 2-3 hours, toss the car on a supercharger for 15 minutes, and does a \"normal\" rest break, they could easily do 500 miles without waiting having to wait more than 15-20 minutes to add enough range to complete 500 miles in a reasonable amount of time. As far as I can tell, only two cars can do this right now, and that is the Tesla Model S and Model 3 extended range. \n\nWe aren't far from electric being practical for long trips for the average citizen, but the cost to do so is prohibitive. I don't see this issue being resolved in 10 years without massive government subsidies.",

Average range of 220 miles on one charge is compared to to a Toyota Rav-4 tank of 14 gallons at 30 miles a gallon is good for 420 miles. And you can go to regular gas station to refuel. I did some more math and I used a Ford F-150. It's gas tank is capable of between 23 to 36 gallons. At 15 to 23 miles to the gallon in the City and 18 to 26 gallons to the mile on the Highway. By these numbers it is capable of these numbers. 15 to 23 is capable of 345 miles - (23 MPG) - 440 mile - (36 MPG)  to 529 miles (23 MPG) - 828 miles - (36 MPG) in City driving and 314 miles (23 MPG) - 644 mile (36 MPG) to 598 miles (26 MPG) - 1096 (26 MPG) in City driving. Again, you can refuel easily since you won't have trouble finding a gas station. And realize this, it has been proven that recharging station use diesel gas to get the energy to recharge them. (How many times to refuel to equal the range of the real ICE truck?) And because the battery is part of the structure of the car you can't put a lot of weight on it or it will crush the battery causing it  to blow up and/or catch on fire.",

Driving at a steady speed, no town driving and no guarantee that when you get to a service station there will be a charging point, and even if there is, you're stuck there for who knows how long before being able to continue.  And, as I said, these cars are brand new. After a couple of years, especially if being regularly 'fast charged' which damages the battery, and allowing for age, say a minimum loss of 10%, added to the fact that no sensible driver is going to risk getting stuck due to a charging point at a service station being out of commission, that 250 miles has become 200 miles, even less if the trip includes some town driving... oh yes, don't forget to turn off the heated anything, if it's raining the windshield wipers will drain faster.. and keep in mind that just building this car was responsible for creating 20 to 25% more harmful emissions than a conventional IC car and will require to be driven for between 200k and 250k km to offset those extra greenhouse gasses, so, they're not even 'Green', with batteries unlikely to survive beyond 12 to 15 years before being trashed and the whole process starts over, at Huge cost.

The System says \"charge now\" at 90miles. the last 10 + the extra 10 would be 20miles extra or like 22% of the complete ride. If i have a Car that can do 300miles and has an extra 10miles at it. I can drive 290miles normaly and the 10miles slow + 10 adidional miles only make around 6-7% with the lower consumption. \n\nTesla has the best efficiency and the longrange hasnt the improvements that Tesla announced last year. They will come this year or next year. Which is claimed to make the car 20% more efficient. Hopefully other manufactures can catch up soon. Most cars are build around traditional designs and not fully embrace electricity. Beyond what the Model Y has coming for efficiency i think reduced weight ( same amount of battery but with less weight + having a car structure that doesnt need to support a heavy battery ) will be the only real efficiency gains. Maybe they can do 1% and 2% there. But like another 10% increase, dont know where that should come from.",

And before anyone else comments, it is usual in the bigger countries to drive long distances in one go.  Cheaper to drive than fly.  For example growing up in Adelaide South Australia, the nearest capital city was Melbourne (500 miles or 800 km).  Used to travel it regularly and took about 7.5 hours in an ICE vehicle.

I assume all are at factory recommended, however how different are those factory recommended values. Will affect all vehicles, as you trade off better suspension if higher psi.\n2. Autopilot/Dashcam using cameras will reduce range a bit as well. I agree the test has to be realistic and drive with autopilot engaged when necessary.

For example, if I bought an 'Electric Car' that claimed only 200mi and achieved 180mi - that's 90% vs a Tesla claiming 400mi and acheiving 200mi is only 50%. It might go 20mi further than the 'Electric Car' but vs the claimed figures and relative monies paid, it actually loses overall.\n\nErm, in my opinion... 😅",

The nessesary work will cost me around the amount i paid for the car, so less than 2k GBP for a super comfy car (hydropneumatic suspension), more range, less wasted time and much higher interior quality. I think a 20 year old car is way better than the new ones. Especially that the range doesn't decrease with time, I can find fuel everywhere and in near future it's going to be more expensive to charge an electric car than it is now.

    "Are electric cars more efficient?\r\nRunning a gasoline car involves:\r\n\r\nBurning gas in the internal combustion engine and converting thermal energy to mechanical energy.

This is only moderately more efficient in a power station than gasoline cars.\r\n\r\nThen, losses begin:\r\n\r\nConverting the mechanical energy of the turbine into electrical energy in the generator involves generator losses\r\n\r\nConverting medium voltage from the generator into high transmission voltage involves transformer losses\r\n\r\nTransmitting the power along the high voltage lines involves transmission losses\r\n\r\nStepping down the voltage in several substations involves transformer losses again\r\n\r\nIn a home charging station, converting 220v power into DC for car charging again involves conversion losses\r\n\r\nA chemical process in the battery being charged heats the battery, involving charging losses\r\n\r\nRunning the car’s electrical motors from the battery requires inverter losses to generate electricity for traction motors and motor losses.\r\n\r\nTake a look at what happens when a driver needs heat in the cab:\r\n\r\nHeating a gasoline car in winter involves redirecting waste heat (hot antifreeze) from the engine into the cab heater, thus not requiring additional fuel.\r\n\r\nHeating an electric car requires a resistance heater or a heat pump, needing to eventually consume more energy from the grid - with all the above conversion losses included.\r\n\r\nWhich process (gasoline car vs. electric) is more efficient at converting fuel, burnt directly in the car engine or at distant power stations, into usable energy to propel a car traveling on a highway?

With the whole zero carbon emissions push there is at the moment, when you factor in the c02 emissions produced while creating an electric car from scratch (and the huge cost of buying an electric car) compared to the c02 emissions of someone just continuing to run a car such as mine, is pushing electric cars on everyone really the right direction to go?",

And on top of that, it looks the best, is probably the most comfortable, and easily wins on boot capacity. I'd say that's a win for the buzz actually",

If you also compare Miles/KWH actual (not indicated) vs claimed, the Nissan wins, the VW comes second and the Mercedes third, the Tesla ties the Genesis for fourth with the Audi coming last.\n\nNow that the EU have backtracked it can only be bad news for current and prospective EV owners as the government will surely kick the can down the road in terms of infrastructure development plans so don’t it expect it to get better any time soon.",

The Percentage-Of-Claimed-Range is a very interesting stat, and what would be really interesting on the next one would be to bring an equivalent petrol and/or diesel ICE along as a full participant (I assume all the camera cars are ICE because they can fill up in 5 mins if needed and will have more range anyway), but not to see if they can go further but to drive until the last EV stops and see how close the ICE cars get to their claimed range, just as a point of interest to see how realistic the two powertrain types are on range/economy claims",

    "I would say the I.D. performed the best on balance. They were all hovering around the 80% mark of their claims because those claims aren't based on sustained high speed. The Buzz being larger and more boxy means it should be more affected by speed thanks to having more drag. \nThat suggests that if you bring the speed down a bit - say 50mph - the Buzz should stand to gain more from the lack of drag. \nI wouldn't say any of them did well though. Not based on the cars but on the chargers. With chargers so sporadic and poorly thought out (along with long charge times and potential queueing) you are relying on what the car can do far more than in an ice. Most of these would be safe to assume 150-200 miles in depending on load, weather and so on. Thats not a lot if you're relying on it to take you somewhere further afield. Its worse if you finish work on a Friday afternoon, drive from work to the schools then head for a weekend away. \n\nI really don't understand the point of long range ev's. On a motorway they use more resources than a decent ice, they are overly heavy from massive batteries, they use a lot of resources to make in the first place and they get used for a tiny amount of that battery most days then are still range limited on a long run. \nEvery single one of these would make a lot more sense with a smaller battery and a range extender. \nWell unless you're the 1% of people who use them to just under their range every day.",

    "Tesla owner here. You can clearly hear the chime letting you know autosteer was manually disabled because you turned the wheel too much while it was changing lanes.

I hold the bottom left or right part of the wheel with one hand when it's driving and it never complains that it can't detect my hand.",

Real world range is relevant, but going 100%-0% isn’t. \n\nRoad trips in a electric vehicle is as much about the car guiding you to the right charging point(s) at the right time to minimise overall time on the road, as it is the other stuff that makes a good road trip vehicle (e.g. comfort etc). \n\nA good EV should tell you when to stop, for how long, pre-condition battery for optimal charging speeds and ease the burden. From what I understand, Tesla is in its own league when it comes to providing the driver with this info. Go watch some EV-drivers like ‘Björn Nyland’ or “Out of spec motoring” to see road trips over 1 000 kms and see how complex or easy it can be done, depending on how the vehicle “helps you”.",

    "It'd be great if you could test the charging curve at the end of the video as well! Range isn't usually as important as charging speed, and charging speed is a lot more than just time until 100%. Example: the Chevy Bolt is a fantastic electric car with class-leading range, but only charges at 50kW peak, making it near impossible for roadtrips. For this reason, a bigger empthasis should be put on charging properties. Being familiar with and showing charging curves would be best, but if not just quoting time to 40%, 80%, and 100% charge would probably do well enough. It's not reccommended to full charge on a roadtrip, that takes far too long, so time to 100% isn't actually very useful.",

    "The Tesla MY has a tow hook in the Frunk!",
    "Me personally, never in my lifetime will purchase an EV. My kinds might some day. Simply put it will run my current diesels to the ground as there will be plenty of spare parts to chose from.",
    "Unfortuntely they didn't die, they just ran out of electricity.",
    "1st. Tesla Model Y 🥇\n2nd. Nissan ARIYA 🥈\n3rd. Genesis GV60 EV 🥉\n4th. Audi Q4 E-Tron Sportback\n5th. Mercedes EQA\n6th. Volkswagen ID. BUZZ",
    "I'd rather stick pins in my eyes.",
    "My new favorite thing to do is sneaking into Nissan dealerships and sticking \"N\"s at the end of their Ariyas tags.",
    "The Tesla makes the most sense.\nUnfortunately, I'm an idiot and would buy the VW.",
    "EV is the worst thing ever i have drived.. Give me V8 every day or D5 Diesel..",
    "Great video Matt. Would love to see something like this with a polestar 2.",
    "if they used “see you again” as bg music while they were leaving tho",
    "Can you do this test with electric trucks (i.e. pickups or full-size suv) towing something heavy?",
    "I really find these very useful, even if I live in a colder climate. These give me very good estimation of the range. One of the reasons why I got myself a eNiro is becaues of it's range in the first electric range test video you did (got I think abut 80% of clamed range). That range has been mostly true for me as well.",
    "Please please please do this with EV vans!!",
    "Ridiculous prices for these cars",
    "I find it funny how the Kodiaq RS camera car likely didn't need to fill up on fuel at all😁",
    "Why not charge the Tesla for 10 minutes?",
    "The test lacked the Ionic 6. And of course the tesla long range plus perhaps mercedes EQB. Think they are the longest EV range cars.",
    "🖐",
    "ranges just are not good enough. Need at least 500 miles to actually make it worthwhile.",
    "Surely the Nissan was the best because it managed 86% of it's claimed range.",
    "Nissan Ariya  cool I didn't see that",
    "Matt .......You are guilty of either driving without due care and attention or driving without reasonable consideration for other road users by purposely running out of fuel",
    "\"Everybody wants an SUV\" Not me. I absolutely hate them. The one advantage you have is the better view, but all the disadvanges of a CoG are there. Poorer dynamics, more weight, more price,, less agile, lower cornering speeds, less efficiency and a long list of etceteras. that dull the experience.",
    "E sucks overall !!!",
    "At the risk of sounding to apologetic, but I think that we have come a long way in getting the ranges on EVs right. It used to be truly atrocious. The fact that 4 out of the 6 came within 1% of 80% of their claimed ranges and the other two were 5% below and 6% above indicates to me that the rules setters and manufacturers are getting better. We can then discuss why it was only 80% (weather, highway only etc), but at least there is pretty good consistency.",
    "The Nissan is the one who won, it was the closest to the claimed range.",
    "tesla tesla tesla",
    "The range tests are the most exciting videos on carwow! Heads up to Genesis and Nissan, overall great cars. The Tesla may have the best efficiency but falls short on every other promise Tesla makes. No thread behind the tow hook cover? That happened to Chinese cars 25 years ago. That's pathetic! Crossing all lines and almost slamming into the middle barrier is another one. Oh, and Elon is a c***.",
    "This furthermore solidifies me not wanting a EV for a lllooonnngggg time.",
    "It's about time you did one of these range tests with a fully loaded car with something like camping gear or fishing equipment and tents, as this is what the cars will eventually be doing when we lose normal vehicles",
    "One would expect the VW to have a massive battery, being basically travel van, and having bigger frame and space for batteries. Imagine going on a big road-trip with it and having to stop every so often to charge. Kills the whole joy out of it.",
    "Its always the Audi with their claimed stats...",
    "Put all the problems with ev,s cars on the internet and YouTube and they have a lot of problems allot of problems",
    "Can you imagine spending 70k on a shitty VW bus that does 0-60 in 10 plus seconds and only does 200 miles per charge?? You would have to be the stupidest human to live. We have gone 50 yrs back in automotive tech overnight. And I'm a VW fan boy.",

    "Come on Matt , where are the lady drivers . None of your vids have any .\n\nThere are women racing drivers now Matt .............come on , catch up",
    "and that's why the ID Buzz is crap",
    "The range of these electric cars is lower than most ice vehicle. The recovery truck was a diesel. 😂",
    "I have a Genesis GV60 Performance. Here in the US we don’t get the rear wheel drive model. I love the car. Plus it’s very fast with a 0-60 of 3.7 seconds. Range is about 235 miles. That’s the only downside.",
    "If this is the future of driving, you can plant me now! 😢\n\nWe've gone from 400-500 mile range with a ice to a couple of hundred or so with restraint going electric. So the future is higher running costs, higher purchase prices, greater depreciation, worse carbon foot print than a 54 year old Ford V8 Mustang!! \n\n\nWho exactly thought this was an improvement for not just us but our descendants! 😢\n\nHeavy metals, recycling that is not cost effective just piling up and we are told the future is orange, well I agree, 'Agent Orange.!'",
    "Bet Matt wasn’t waiting 5 hours like I was for AA other day 😂",
    "Hey Mat , here’s a drag race idea for the future: BMW M550i vs Merc S580 vs Audi SQ7 vs Cayenne GTS.\n\nSeems so random but the reasoning is all of these are the “entry” V8 models of their respective manufacuter without going the full M/AMG/RS treatment. The “lowest” model you can get a V8 in. I wonder how they would stack up",
    "These are for 4+ passengers and yet I’ve never seen one tested with 4/5 people in them. I bet the range is crap with another 300kg+",
    "Why isn’t a Renault Megane Etech? It has tremendous autonomy",
    "How was the weather? That could also affect the range",
    "So ... 70% of claim range is average real world range",
    "1 ID Buzz please! I need all that space.",
    "Eight million subs! Congrats!",
    "Always love these videos",
    "Thanks for re-confirming that I will not be a buyer of an EV. Internal combustion engines are more reliable, cost less, and require less energy to make.",

    "WoW :)  I was so wrong about Merc win this challenge .",
    "Don't be lane hogging you should always be in the left lane where possible",
    "None of them get close to their claimed range.",
    "Next up, luxury limousine battle. Lucid air, Tesla palladium, Mercedes eqs, bmw i7, maybe throw in a taycan or etron gt",
    "Surely something needs to be done about the range claims manufacturers make - regardless if it’s and EV, Petrol or Diesel. I’ve had about 13 cars so far and not one of them has ever come close to the claimed range or MPG!",
    "I shout ‘nobhead’ at my Tesla too 😂 made me laugh that",
    "Electric car is not future, wrong way",
    "BYD?",
    "Tesla is Tesla. Model Y best of 2023.",
    "This gentleman doing outstanding job to spend our money in a right direction.",
    "Model Y claimed range is 331 miles and not 351 miles that Matt mistakenly mentioned... That is 86% of claimed range meaning it tops efficiency as well.",
    "I've watched plenty of these tests and *miles per kilowatt hour* properly tells you 90% of what you need to know immediately.   Which is why all the electric cars will tell you this.  There are some numb nuts (not Matt) who insist on Killowatts per 100 miles, which shows that they are emotionally disturbed, and information challenged.\n\nThese are the folks whom if you ask them about the efficiency of petrol vehicles, will give you the *feet per 100 liters.*  🤣 I mean....bloody hell!",
    "Carwow lost all credibility wlen they faked a brake test with a model X Plaid on winter tyres competing with performance SUV on performance summer tyres. Don't watch their bullshit.",
    "Really love these tests - Mat and the team do a real service for prospective UK EV buyers! One request - could you add the price of each car to the final results graphics too?",
    "More of these \"how far will they go\" videos please!",
    "I just checked my tyre pressures on my MYP 42PSi ! Now at 35 way better ride…",
    "Such a useful test. Adding a km score next to miles would be the finishing touch. Thanks so much!",
    "8m 🎉",
    "That's the ugliest Aston Martin ever. Is it a Citroen?",
    "well german cars are quit not there with their battery tech which is sad 🤔especially VW buzz should have much more range with it potential to hide bigger battery in it !! IF EU opens for new Chinese EV cars they going to be destroyed range wise 😮‍💨",
    "Is it okay if we can see the electric brands of Audi and Kia in a drag race which one is better Audi owns Kia",
    "65 grand????? To what? Save money on fuel? Buy a transporter T6 and drive 200k miles on the difference",
    "Thanks Matt for these very informative tests. Unfortunately, I won't want to paying north of £50k for car that can barely reach 220 miles on a full charge 😳 I'd be having an anxiety attack if it hit red! Not to mention the charging time!",
    "Really if you go by percentage of claimed range the vw came 3rd not bad",
    "Fast charges shorten the battery life. EV's are not a convincing alternative. Still a long way to go yet before they are a viable mode of private transport.",
    "What happens when someone puts their car on charge and buggers off shopping and doesn't come back for hours? I see people getting frustrated when you're waiting at the petrol station and the person infront sits putting there wallet/purse away ,check their mirrors, puts seat belt on , double check they did take back their bankcard ,then start the car and drive off, l can see a lot of trouble happening around charging points",
    "But I don't want or even need a SUV  or larger vehicle, my children are all grown up and gone and generally only me and the wife travel in my car. Where's the fun, the cars we want rather than just need?\nI understand the wider market is all about SUVs etc but I'm haven't given up on driving just yet, where are our future electric cars?",
    "Congrats on 8 million.",
    "Matt probably doesn’t know but, the wipers did not turn off during his voice command because he was in auto pilot when it is raining. While in Auto Pilot, auto wipers and auto high beams are on and cannot be turned off.",
    "really don't like the colour of the genesis, looks like a colour an old person would pick for their Micra",
    "was the Nissan AWD or RWD…. didnt mention it on the video….",
    "In England, is it that important to know how far an EV goes?",
    "A694 Dishing out fines for fun on that stretch, half 2 in the morning no traffic doing airport pick up. So many fines...",
    "Love you",
    "Yay! Nissan won!🇯🇵💪",
    "man the english people driving on the wrong side of the road always make me unconfortable when i wach open road videos",
    "Great video but the real problem is the charging infrastructure in the UK, it's crap. Range anxiety is a larger issue in the UK",
    "Autopilot isn't doing things it used to do, because of eu restrictions.\nBefore it would take off-ramps on its own, this is nog longer allowed because of European lawmakers.\n\nIf you want to see what the system can do, don't drive it in Europe.\nThere's loads of other restrictions, how long the car can attempt to make a lane change, how fast it can turn the wheel,...\n\nYou need to confirm everything the car wants to do.\n\nAlso you can't turn of windshield wipers when in autopilot.\n\nPlease don't misinform people about the system not working when it's working as intended and restricted by laws.\n\nALSO if you select a charger in the navigation, it will pre-heat the battery and use a lot of energy to achieve faster charging.\nWhile it's a big advantage while travelling, it's a massive disadvantage on a test like this.\nThe car could have probably reached the charger if you had turned of pre-heating.",
    "I you want to talk about long range EV, you should try the Lucid Air Dream. It's close to 500 miles !!!",
    "I believe the Nissan won since it did the most of its claimed range. Also the tesla sure looked like it was drafting off the Genesis a lot!!",
    "So you can buy a second hand EV or buy a second hand DERV and save yourself £30+k which you can spend on anything you want too   8-))...",
    "I would love to see one of these tests repeated with the same cars under summer temperatures... can any of them achieve the legal government mandated range measurement?",
    "I really like the content on this channel.",
    "So one can take roughly 20% off of any manufacturers‘ claimed range to get close to reality.",
    "I like the quick review on the chargers when stopped. I think at the end of the video when the cars have flat batteries they should do a charging race to 200 miles or 80% just so people know what car has the best charging curve",
    "We need more of these EV range Videos. The only thing I would change is making a list everytime you ask the others about the range. Otherwise it's rather hard to comprehend.",
    "sick vid",
    "So, still pretty useless on range, takes an eternity to 'fill up' and waaaay more expensive.  Hopefully by 2030 they'll sort all these things out.  Till then i'll keep on guzzling the gas.",
    "The tesla confirming Tesla cliches: Best efficiency but also autopilot not as good as advertised and random quality problem like the rear toweye not threaded",
    "So the Tesla goes the furthest, has the best efficiency, has the 2nd most cargo room, is BY FAR the quickest, has the most power, has AWD, and isn’t that expensive. Why are all of the other cars so far behind Tesla? It is almost like everyone else waited to long to get into the Electric game.😉",

    "Merc will do longest in my experiences while look YT .But I do not like EV`s in there now miles/ gallon /kw.",

    "Congratulations to carwow for hitting 8 million subs 🎉 can’t believe I’ve been subscribed since 800 thousand subs",
    "Tesla",
    "I struggle with EVs, I’m not convinced they are the future due to the materials used in the battery and the emissions emitted whilst producing them meaning you need to drive around 60k miles before it’s offset. I regularly do 300 mile road trips and the main limitation is my bladder 😂 so a quick 5 min break and I want to hit the road again. Having to delay at least 20mins each time to recharge would be a large inconvenience.",
    "Yep hands down the tesla is the best in my book",
    "I love these video but the thing I would love even more is conversion to kilometers mby in a small number at bottom of the video, pleasee",

    "Awesome 🤩👌",
    "So the Nissan won.",
    "If you drove at motorway speed for the entire test, the range would be even less\nIf you only used the battery from 85-15% as the manufacturers recommend, the motorway range starts getting even more ridiculously low\nEV manufacturers get away with giving complete nonsense theoretical ranges that are not achievable in real life, this needs dealing with, being 20% out on not even a strenuous test shows that they are getting away with just making up the figures",
    "Just went back to the stone age. A horse is more convenient, or a donkey..!! What a misery these EV's . Stop that stupid laugh please, I like my Mercedes 220CDI of 2001. Range of 1000km's fill it up in 5 minutes at every gas station...brilliant.",

    "Maaan, that Tesla is sooo ugly.",
    "hey Matt you can't turn off the auto wipers when in autopilot in a Tesla. That's why the wipers off voice command didn't work.",
    "I love these vids",

    "Feels like the Merc or VW",
    "It's crazy times when a cheaper Nissan feels more expensive than a more expensive Mercedes. Shows how much Mercedes standards have plummeted. They don't feel like they used to. Cheap plastics everywhere.",

    "19:18 Jesus, you are such a amateur, you disengaged and you compain about it being not clever",
    "How did the Tesla drive for so much longer yet stop driving before the other vehicles? Also, doesn't claimed range include a good amount of city driving?",
    "Most likely the Tesla",
    "That was really entartaining! But the honest winner should be the car with the most percent of claimed range. So you know for what to expect",
    "I’m betting Nissan.",
    "19:00 You don't have NoA engaged, you have just normal autopilot, if you were in Navigate on Autopilot, you would have just one lane, not two on the display",

    "30:50 why is the bottom part of it where the Vehicle Shutting Down warning flashing red?",
    "I'm so glad I live in the US. FSD is literally driving me from A to B without taking over at all. Matt can't even keep it engaged. Lol",
    "When will carwow learn we don't care about their website. Stop advertise it. you make all your money from youtube!",
    "Absolutely contrived, kind of saw it coming when you celebrated taking over the Tesla for the last leg, when it was clearly going to win by a big margin. Good entertainment though, I can see why you make shed loads of cash, surrounding the Tesla with piles of drama before only paying lip-service to the fact that it blatently won by a country mile. Reminds me of Top Gear scripting the Model S konking out about a decade ago, which, coincidentally is how far the competition lag by😂",
    "Correction Tesla says 330 mi on model Y but the model 3 is 351, the two are often confused.\nOh and every time you tried making the autopilot turn into another lane you where actually turning off the autopilot and letting the car almost fly into the barrier it was going to make the change but you turned the wheel and that turns it off.",

    "These vids are fun, but in the interest of balance,  why not do one with fossils and see how far you get for the cost comparison of the millage an EV gets on a full battery charged from home on night rate electricity?? because we're a little obsessed with the whole range thing when most people only ever do about 30 to 100 mile a day and fossil burns a hole in your pocket to get the same range as an EV.",
    "Tesla's \"Autopilot\" is a very expensive misnomer. Also, I think the rankings should be for which car comes closest to it's claimed range, not which car goes the furthest. That is a fairer test IMHO.",

    "So what you’re saying is Matt. The worst car/van ID Buzz, Is the one you like most. Apart from its funky retro looks, it really is a terrible car/van. Even as just a people carrier. The rear windows don’t open and there is no rear ventilation. That would be fun on a hot day for the poor rear passengers. Wasn’t the Nissan the cheapest? Look how brilliant that is. It also got closest to its claimed range. 😅",
    "Matt, can you get a Model Y from Berlin factory and review?",
    "Reminds me of the race with the Audi when you got lost in the Tesla and left the free flowing motorway to join a traffic jam. Good effort 👌",
    "So they all only went about 80% of their claimed range.",

Could you help me understand  why you didn't stay on the road and go to the choice of  superchargers that you would have comfortably reached? The Tesla had 51 miles of range doing 3.9 miles per kwh whilst the Genesis had 19 miles doing  3.4 miles per kwh....and the Tesla ended up in a field and the Genesis \"won\"😂",

    "Circa 50k upwards for cars that can't do 300 miles from a tank is utter BS. Jokers",
    "It might be the rolls royce Van to pay almost 70k EUR for that 😂",
    "So all of them lie about range,ridiculously  long charging times, and no mention of how much it cost to charge. Joke😂",
    "Missing iX1!",
    "I don't understand why you don't have one of those battery packs that can give you 3Kwh of charge? You could just keep it in the boot.",
    "19:23 he pushed the steering wheel too far. this disengaged AP. you also cant switch wipers off while in AP hence it doesnt do it.",
    "ID Buzz made by Mattel.",
    "Another pointless test about range. No country roads, no accelerations, no 90 mph, 100% to 0% even if you never get to zero and never would charge to 100 (if u aren't at home)",
    "✋️",
    "Ghost at 9:25 lol",
    "Again no model s or x. You should include one in one of these videos.",
    "Matt i wanted to see the toyota bx4",
    "I would like to see comparision between petrol, diesel and Ev car. What Is the cheapest way to travel.",
    "can pls anyone test the Mercedes EQS, BMW I7 and the Tesla Model s in longrange",
    "Hopefully none of them are fitted with winter tires",
    "Keep these coming",
    "Anticipation: Tesla will rule all. Biggest car maker in 2 to 3 years. By far.",
    "From the range update shots they all seemed to be crawling along at 50-60 mph. Slight BS vibe to me.",
    "Every time that Mat is talking about price I want to cry from desperation. I mean we are talking about insane prizes. Not worth it in my opinion. You want to save fuel and money without the range anxiety? Buy a small used car.  Unless you are into that show off bs.",
    "Matt, you know that you actually turned off the \"clever stuff\" at 19:17 :) there was a sound and icon went from blue to gray..also that beeping sound mean that you are departing your lane... so you were the one who went all across the road :D otherwise i love these videos... great job",
    "Most importantly the efficiency of the tesla is highest. Also means less costs for charging.",
    "When will you drive the Nio cars? I'm curious about how it stands to the others",
    "30:37 Oh-oh, did the Tezzla leave you stranded, again? 😂\nI bet an ICE car can go 500 miles, because it is made for icey conditions. 🙃",
    "Very profesional test. All the relevant comparising infos for every car, also driving impresions, and fun atmosphere. Matt is a comedy actor, a technical tester, and a video producer in the same time. Fully deserved the 8M subscribers. Congrats and admiration.",
    "Not far enough…and expensive to run & buy…😂",
    "Electric 🥱",
    "Well, considering that the temparature control was enabled, interior lights and all the extra goodies, I would say the claimed ranges are not too far off.",
    "Fraud alert!",
    "Carwow, just curious, why didn't you guys call in the portable charging van just like in the previous ev videos instead of a flatbed?",
    "Using a walkie talkie on the motorway isn't that the same as using a phone?! 🤔\nNaughty Matt 😆",
    "EQS vs Taycan vs i7",
    "God the range on these EVs are absolutely rubbish compared to ICEs. And how embarrassing (and dangerous!) would it be if by chance you skipped one too many charge stations to crawl like that on a motorway!!!\n\nThanks but no thanks. I'll stick to my ICE",
    "I just love these EV range challenge videos, they're the real world capabilites of these vehicles.",
    "37:20 at this stats the best choice for EV beginner is Nisan car more range than other 4 cars 267, low energy at 3.2, and most important 86% as claimed range that give more safe calculation for long trip.",
    "Tesla y cause they are sexy like a fish",
    "Atto 3...or wait for Dacia...these ridiculous expensive bloated monstrosity things no thanks",
    "What? you gonna wait 1 hour to fill the Tesla all the way up to 100% and then drive 5 miles to your home and sleep? why not wait 5 min to get 20% charge and and then plug it in at home?\nI know you have a home charger Matt!🤔",
    "I was just watching the other ones and this dropped! looking forward to see who wins.",
    "Can t be third biggest or third smallest boot out of 6 car comparison",
    "The ID Buzz is a terrible design. It's a 5 seater car that happens to look like a van.\nHalf of the car is the front cabin.",
    "The Nissan did the closest to its claimed range , so to me that's the winner",
    "Thanks Mat for this nice video!",
    "75% from claimed Audi. That's weak!",
    "Love the VW. Not quite the camper one will need yet but the Tesla is the king of the EV road and I suspect it will be for a long time. They are light years ahead, relatively speaking.",
    "i hate electric cars but i love these vidoes 🤣",
    "Can’t wait for the Bus to come stateside!",
    "The Tesla was the least efficient, it must have the biggest battery giving it the longest range.",
    "To be realistic you should compare 80%-20% and not 100% - 0%",
    "5:35 strange that you don't mention that a 10 minute drive before that location, there are more chargers (with more stalls)  and Tesla Super chargers with 6 stalls\n7:45 so again 5 minute drive before that location is a Tesla Super charger with 8 stalls and PodPoint with another 8 stalls. Though obvious ice cars shouldn't park there...\n11:25 ...you guessed it, more charging 10 minutes before that location including Tesla Superchargers with 8 stalls and Charge Point with 8 stalls\n14:30 at least they have something semi reasonable to say this time...though again there are more local ones. Not mentioning Tesla Supercharger integration being much much better?\n\nSeems odd approach here...is carwow saying the infrastructure is non existent or that its just terrible? Neither are true for Tesla, but there was no mention of that",
    "Congrats on 8million",
    "Actually the winners are:\nRange: Nissan with 86% of claimed range followed by the Tesla with 81%\nEfficacy: Tesla with 3.9 mi/kWh followed by the Genesis with 3.5\n\nDistance means nothing when you have a bigger battery to spend.",
    "Best type of video on carwow",
    "Sucks you use mpg/miles, use km/l/10km  like the rest of the modern world 😅",
    "Gridserve are being pushed out of welcome break services by restricting their power so that they can add their own Applegreen chargers, naughty naughty!",
    "I'd take the Nissan any day. It looks good and performed really well.",
    "Tesla all day every day",
    "boring ! . . .  next !",
    "Kinda love the interveiw😂❤",
    "Why not a bmw",
    "probably the Tesla will go the furthest.",
    "So Tesla is the most spacious and practical, has the largest boot, has the most equipment, is the fastest and most efficient, has the highest range and is one of the cheapest of the lot. Slam fuckin dunk!",
    "I have been lucky with charging, only once arriving with having to wait 20 minutes.\nI always use an app to navigate to a working and available charger.\nAlso, my EV seems to be more efficient than those in this test.",
    "Shouldn't the winner be the one with higher percentage of claimed range?",
    "tesla",
    "Great video although the ID buzz isn’t based on a van. It’s based on the MEB car platform, the same as the rest of the ID range, the Audi Q4 & 5 and Skoda Enyaq.",
    "These tests should be done mid-winter fully loaded cargo and weight capacity to show the absolute real world case scenarios.",
    "Will you PLEASE stick with the metric system!!",
    "If you divide the range by the battery capacity physically you get much different efficiencies... hmmm Nissan actually has the best efficiency",
    "Try the Lucid Air in the next video!",
    "Signature Show ❤",
    "Where is the bmw",
    "Farthest not furthest.",
    "57000 pounds and you get a plastic interior. VW is just shit. As per the range, no wonder it’s bad, you’re basically moving a fridge through the air",
    "where is the electric bmw ix?",
    "I'm a van man.",
    "I LOVE THE ID BUZZ !! its actually crazy",
    "My vauxhall vivaro has a range of 600+ miles on a tank of diesel 😅",
    "Actually I was planning to enter video scroll till end and check result and then I started to listen what Matt want to stay and watch whole episode.....",
    "My diesel mercedes turns off its windscreen wipers more reliably , wouldn’t trust this tech it’s a prototype",
    "Nissan is getting extra points for getting closest to the claimed range. 🎉\n\nEven while beeing shaped like that.",
    "mi/kWh is not energy consumption but energy efficiency. Because a higher number equals higher efficiency.",
    "Genuine question: this channel is designed to disprove climate change by adding unnecessary carbon into the atmosphere by  drag racing vehicles?",
    "I personally think the best looking car is the Audi Q4",
    "Patiently waiting for EX90 too, this is brilliant video ever created the people, the crew involved in it, you have my respect! Thank you",
    "Please do a used electric car range test, that would be genuinely useful.",
    "Yap",
    "Your answer at 36:15",
    "M3LR…",
    "Hey I wanted to let you know that the GV60 full specs does a 0-60 in 3.8 seconds.",
    "I'm not ready to hug trees....😂",
    "Anyone else have fluttering in the right channel?",
    "Nissan ariya is very worth the money because of the price and it's have more range that some expensive EV",
    "Very nice series as always! Sad but the most boring and bland car won, gz Tesla",
    "Man, there has to be more to keep these vehicles interesting. Manufacturers have to get more creative.",
    "Mat ALWAYS likes to win the challenges",
    "How long did you have to wait for the AA Mat ?",
    "Of course Tesla",
    "I like electric cars but the range puts me off also the cost of replacing a battery is pricey but even more putting off is the cost of electricity now going up and up .. they want people to use more electric cars but are making it so that people won't want one. So for me it's a no until things change dramatically",
    "I'm impressed by Genesis and Nissan. Quite good range I think",
    "People are delusional. Average person should never have any range anxiety... Where in the world you drive 200-300 miles in one sitting... Are you crazy or what.",
    "The winner in my opinion I'd the nissan as it was the closest to the claimed range",
    "merc",
    "Entertaining show ........",
    "Hey you guys hit 8m subs 🎉",
    "Watching Mat fumble with the navigate on autopilot is so funny... even turning off the autopilot by nudging the wheel too hard when trying to change lines. Tesla has not released the functions related to exiting roads etc. in Europe yet. Only in the US. It is all a bit confusing, but it is our lawmakers fault.. they are not allowed to release the functions, so we are all stuck on an old FSD version basically - which is why it fails like that. \n\nDo love the car though - the Tesla is definitely the best of the bunch. Best range, dual motor, great power, great charging speeds, great charging network and actually... since the started building in China and Berlin, the quality is pretty good too.. with Berlin being the best in my opinion, and very little hard plastics like in the Audi. I would say that in terms of price vs. what you get, it is definitely the best of the bunch.",
    "Would be good if EV's allowed portable battery packs for emergency use.",
    "Is the volume of the Tesla's boot calculated based on the American measurement that takes into account all the space behind the rear seats from floor to ceiling? \n\nMost European manufacturers seem to state the volume as the space behind the rear seats but below the maximum height of the rear seats.",
    "I’d love to know how much each car cost to charge to 100% for comparisons to ICE vehicles? (I appreciate that can vary dependant on where it’s charged but a rough average would be great)",
    "What a world we live in. RWD VW MPV, and FWD Mercedes SUV",
    "Why are all these range tests done on a motorway? Why not do it on streets with traffic, and traffic light stops and just a normal commute and then see the range?",
    "Beautiful congo made vehicles. Lovely lovely, apparently Congolese children love digging for those batteries....... Save the planet wooo",
    "Go on tesla 🎉",
    "Isn't this the perfect situation to standardize the consumption figures? \nNow we don't have to deal with gallons anymore, just show the consumption in kWh/100km or kWh/62Mi instead of mpkWh. \n1Watt=1Joule/second=1kilogram.meter squared divided by seconds cubed. \nJust make it yourself easy for once.",
    "So the camera car was a petrol? ",
    "The tesla is my favourite car",
    "Yeeess i love these series",
    "Start in night, by the time battery is finished its morning and viewers can see in good quality",
    "Nissan results is very impressed me to be honest 🤯",
    "20:44 You can't turn off wipers when in autopilot. Love the video Mat!",
    "Tesla i think ,that's only because it's the Boss of electric motors",
    "Soo many ads 🙈🙈🙈 stopped watching after 15mins 🥲",
    "review a gv60 please",
    "24:28 ah nice license plate my guy 😂",
    "Shove your ev",
    "Fantastic! More videos on EVs please.",
    "Carwow is the best car review channel on YouTube",
    "The ID Buzz uses the same heating element/resistor to heat up the cabin as the ID3 and ID4. For its size this is not enough and winter tests done in Finland this year showed that even after 30 minutes of driving the temperature of the rear foot well was below freezing when the outside temperature was -15°C.\n\nThis van really needs a heat pump and a larger heating element.",
    "Anyone else notice how most cars have their worst efficiency when Mat is driving them? 😂",
    "112km/h is rubbish. do a test with those at 120-130km/h or more and see how then claim range looks like in reality.",
    "Video Reposted?",
    "I was hoping to be one of the NIO cars in this experiment",
    "heated seats use negligible energy, wont make any difference to your tests",
    "Electric cars are shit.",

    "ow try the rimack nevera vs model s tesla",
    "Anyone watching this and still thinks EVs are just a S**T package overall😂",
    "i  love these tests. as an owner of a 2023 Tesla, its interesting to see the competitions range!",
    "Damn, no MG4 Trophy. I want to know what happens when it runs out, hope it doesn't lock out.",
    "Big Load Matt? 🤓",
    "Keep these type of videos coming. I would like to see some go against ICE cars with the same range.\n\nOh and congrats on the 8M subscribers",
    "Congratulations on 8 million!!",
    "Tesla - 285 Miles / 3.9mi/Kwh\nNissan - 267 Miles / 3.2mi/Kwh\nGenesis - 253 Miles / 3.5mi/Kwh\nAudi - 235 Miles / 3.2mi/Kwh\nMercedes - 208 Miles / 3.2mi/Kwh\nVW - 203 Miles / 2.7mi/Kwh\n\nClear connection between efficiency and range.",

    "Weird seeing the IDbuzz there",
    "early",
    "Does anybody care about the slave\nLabour of 5 year old mining for lithium and cobalt to make these batteries. Or is this forgotten and lost within the great climate scam. Keep your electric vehicles. Matt, maybe you should think about how these cars are made before showing them",
    "Not sure why but i like these type of videos",
    "come on carwow, please cancel this freedom number nonesense :D good video tho!",
    "Am I the only waiting for the Sl 63 review video and drag races?",
